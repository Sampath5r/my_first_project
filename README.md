Users can input the daily usage hours for common household appliances, such as lights, fans, TVs, air conditioners, and refrigerators. Based on the usage hours, appliance power ratings, rate per unit (kWh), and chosen currency, the application calculates and displays the total monthly bill.
Real-Time Bill Calculation: Calculate the estimated electricity bill in real time based on appliance usage.
Currency Selection: Choose the preferred currency to display the final bill.
Custom Rate per Unit: Input a custom rate for electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh).
Easy to Use Interface: Simple and intuitive design for quick inputs and instant results.
